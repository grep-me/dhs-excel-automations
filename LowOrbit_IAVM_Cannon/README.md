# LowOrbit_IAVM_Cannon
A recreation to the Tenible Nessus IAVM mapping feature writen in Powershell. Intended for ACAS systems going through onboarding that are manually mapping IAVM's to CVE's. This is a TEMPORARY solution to red tape that saves 20-30 weekly man hours of mapping IVAM's to CVE's by hand. 

[+] This tool requires the newest IAVM notice in csv format which can be found here: https://iavm.csd.disa.mil/
- Warning, use of this site is strictly prohibited to autherized personel and will require CAC authentication to access.

[+] The SOP for how to run this tool can be found by inquiring the USCG ALC ISD IA team.
